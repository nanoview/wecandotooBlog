-- ðŸ”’ Fix Visitor Sessions RLS Policies
-- This script creates proper RLS policies for visitor tracking

-- First, let's check current policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('visitor_sessions', 'post_impressions');

-- Enable RLS on visitor_sessions if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE visitor_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE post_impressions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies to recreate them properly
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read on visitor_sessions" ON visitor_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert on visitor_sessions" ON visitor_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public update on visitor_sessions" ON visitor_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow service role full access on visitor_sessions" ON visitor_sessions;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read on post_impressions" ON post_impressions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert on post_impressions" ON post_impressions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public update on post_impressions" ON post_impressions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow service role full access on post_impressions" ON post_impressions;

-- Create policies for visitor_sessions
-- Allow anonymous users to insert their own sessions
