# Zoho Email Authentication Guide

## Real Zoho Mail Integration with IMAP

The Email Monitor now supports **real Zoho Mail authentication** using your actual username and password credentials through secure IMAP connection.

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Email Monitor
1. Navigate to the Admin Panel
2. Go to the "Email Monitor" tab
3. Select "IMAP" as your email checking method

### 2. Authentication Process
1. **Enter Credentials**: You'll see a secure login form
2. **Username**: Your full Zoho email address (e.g., hello@wecandotoo.com)
3. **Password**: Your Zoho account password (app password recommended)
4. **Connect**: Click "Connect to Zoho Mail"

### 3. Security Features
- âœ… **No Storage**: Credentials are never saved or stored permanently
- âœ… **Secure Connection**: Uses IMAP over TLS (imap.zoho.com:993)
- âœ… **App Passwords**: Supports Zoho app-specific passwords (recommended)
- âœ… **Connection Testing**: Validates credentials before use
- âœ… **Easy Logout**: Clear session with one click

### 4. What Happens After Login
- **Automatic Email Check**: Immediately fetches latest emails
- **Real-time Data**: Shows actual emails from hello@wecandotoo.com
- **Unread Highlighting**: Identifies new/unread messages
- **Secure Session**: Maintains connection until logout

## App Password Setup (Recommended)

For enhanced security, use Zoho app-specific passwords:

1. Go to Zoho Mail Settings
2. Navigate to Security settings
3. Generate an app-specific password
4. Use this password instead of your main account password

## IMAP Configuration Details

## Production Deployment

1. Move IMAP connection to backend service
