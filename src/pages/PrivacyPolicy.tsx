            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We use cookies, local storage, and other tracking technologies to help customize the Site and improve your experience. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what we use and why:

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Authentication Tokens (Essential)</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">We use `localStorage` to store secure tokens (JWTs) provided by Supabase. This allows you to stay logged in to your account without having to sign in on every visit. This is essential for the site's functionality.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Application Tokens (Functional)</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">For certain integrations, like Zoho Mail, we store access tokens in `localStorage`. This allows these features to work correctly and securely without repeatedly asking for your credentials.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-800">Service Worker Cache (Performance)</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">As a Progressive Web App (PWA), our site uses a service worker to cache assets like scripts, stylesheets, and images. This allows the site to load significantly faster on repeat visits and even work when you're offline.</p>
